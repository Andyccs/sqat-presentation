\frametitle{Conclusion}
We have developed the foundation of SQAT:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Identify the main goal is to build an automatic code assessment tool
  \item Use Goal Question Metric approach to quantify software quality attributes
  \item Use ANTLR as the main tool to collect software metrics
  \item Use microservices architecture to develop SQAT
  \item Implement the framework proposed by Washizaki et al. (2007) for measurement component
\end{itemize}

\frametitle{Future Recommendation}

SQAT can be further improved in five ways:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Conducting acceptance testing
  \item Implementing a rating level deriving tool
  \item Developing a better software quality metric calculator
  \item Developing a more comprehensive Goal Question Metric
  \item Supporting more configuration file formats
\end{itemize}
