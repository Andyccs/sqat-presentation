Students submit codes to complete exercises, assignments and projects in NTU. Most of the time:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Assignments are assessed based on reports only
  \item Codes are not assessed
\end{itemize} \pause

Infeasible to assess codes because we lack of:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Objectives
  \item Human resources
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\frametitle{Objective}

\begin{block}{Long-term Goal}
To develop Software Quality Analysis Tools (SQAT), a tool that is able to assess the quality of the source codes automatically.
\end{block} \pause

SQAT will asses the quality of source codes by considering the structural metrics:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Object-oriented metrics
  \item Coding standards
\end{itemize}

\frametitle{Scope}

Since this project was started from scratch, in this project, we:

\begin{itemize}
  \item determine a scalable architecture
  \item built software quality measurement tool
  \item built a front-end web application
\end{itemize}
